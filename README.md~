No Libraries Required!!! This project uses all native Linux code. You'll just need the 'cmake' package to build it!

### Configuration Files ###
There are two bot config files you can use.

1. botconfig.txt contains information you'll need to obtain to run the bot You'll need to insert your account name associated with the bot, and the channel name of the channel you'd like the bot to be active in. Finally, you'll need to obtain your oauth code from Twitch. To obtain this, log into your bot account and naviagte to this link: http://twitchapps.com/tmi/ Copy the contents of the page and then paste it into the oauth line.
2. adminusers.txt is a line delimited file of usernames who will have "admin status" on bot commands. These users will have elevated permissions.

### Additional Info ###
This bot contains all of the basics you'll need to get going. See the TwitchPrivMsg.cpp file for examples on how to set up custom commands. The TwitchIRC.cpp file contains all of the initialization code you'll need to use the bot in channels.
